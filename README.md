# greVocabQuiz
This repo is for a py quiz app for GRE Vocab

Download the complete source code, install Python on your local machine, and just run the main.py file.
The rest is intutive.

This is the very first version of the whole idea and hence is still like a pilot episode, will be adding GUI soon.
